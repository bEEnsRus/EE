reincarnated as a bramble
     Brackey is a average every day highschooler with a hobby. He loved taking care of plants, escpecially brambles. Infact, his favorite type of plant were brambles. A Rubus Fruticosus to be exact. He took care of it every day, carefully watering it and giving it more attention than he gave himself.
     On a random sunny day, Brackey was going into his garden to water his plants and harvest some with his new sickle. All of the sudden, he tripped on his shoelaces and fell onto his bramble. By pure coincidence, a massive branch happened to pierce his eye and dig its way into his brain as everything went dark for poor Brackey.
